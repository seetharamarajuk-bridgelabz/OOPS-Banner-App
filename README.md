# OOPS-Banner-App
"OOPS Banner App - Object-Oriented Programming Learning Project"
OOPS Banner App starts with the simple use case of displaying OOPS in the console to extending the use case to display in a Banner Format using space and * and goes on to refactor the code to make it more modular using functions then defining a class to store the character pattern and finally using a map to store the character pattern and use function to display the OOPS in a Banner Format
